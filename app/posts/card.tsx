        <p>Should you give a person a second chance? I'm sure everyone has asked themselves this question, to give a chance or not? After all, if there is no second chance, there will be no person next to you, but what if you do give a person this chance? What will happen? Will he improve and try to become better? Or will he take this chance for granted? Somewhere inside you understand that nothing will change, that the person will remain the same. Nothing will change. He will continue to hurt you. You tell yourself: "no, there will be no second chance", but after a while not only second, but also third, fourth, fifth chances appear. All this is useless. But you see that this is wrong, and why are you looking for arguments and justifications for this person, for whom, in fact, getting another chance is a common thing. You think that you will give a person a chance and he will perceive it as a gift, will be grateful to you. It will not. People do not change. Who has seen people who changed after they were awarded another chance? I haven't seen it. 12.09.24</p>
